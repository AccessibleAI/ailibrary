# ResNet50

## General
ResNet, short for Residual Networks is a classic neural network used as a backbone for many computer vision tasks. This model was the winner of ImageNet challenge in 2015. The fundamental breakthrough
 with ResNet was it allowed us to train extremely deep neural networks with 150+layers successfully. Prior to ResNet training very deep neural networks was difficult due to the problem of vanishing 
 gradients.

## Note for this library
The library is a wrapper for the ``Tensorflow2`` implementation of the ResNet50 module. The library enables the user to create deep neural network based on ResNet50.
It might be used both for colored ('rgb') images and for black-white image ('grayscale') by the parameter ```--image_color```.
The library also enables the user to load the images directly from the local directory. By default, the library needs the recive single path (``--data``) for a local directory.
When doing this, the library splits the content of the directory to train set and validation/test set according to the parameter ```--test_size``` which by default equals 0.2.
If the user is also interested in supplying test set, it can be given to the parameter ```--data_test```. If the user supplied it, the library performs: training, validation and testing.

## Parameters
```--data``` - (String) (Required param) Path to a local directory which contains sub-directories, each for a single class. The data is used for training and validation.

```--data_test``` - (String) (Default: None) Path to a local directory which contains sub-directories, each for a single class. The data is used for testing. 

```--output_model``` - (String) (Default: 'resnet50_model.h5') The name of the output model file. It is recommended to use '.h5' file.

```test_size``` - (float) (Default: 0.2) The size of the validation / test set. If test set supplied, it represents the size of the validation set out of the data 
set given in --data. Otherwise, it represents the size of the test set out of the data set given in --data.

```epochs``` - (int) (Default: 1) The number of epochs the algorithm performs in the training phase.

```batch_size``` - (int) (Default: 256) The number of images the generator downloads in each step.

```image_color``` - (String) (Default: 'rgb') The colors of the images. Can be one of: 'grayscale', 'rgb'.

```--optimizer``` - (String) (Default: 'adam') The optimizer the algorithm uses. Can be one of: 'adam', 'adagrad', 'rmsprop', 'sgd'.

```image_height``` - (int) (Default: 128) The height of the images.

```image_width``` - (int) (Default: 128) The width of the images.

```conv_width``` - (int) (Default: 3) The width of the convolution window.

```conv_height``` - (int) (Default: 3) The height of the convolution window.

```pool_width``` - (int) (Default: 2) The width of the pooling window.

```pool_height``` - (int) (Default: 2) The height of the pooling window.

```hidden_layer_activation``` - (String) (Default: 'relu') The activation function of the hidden layers.

```output_layer_activation``` - (String) (Default: 'softmax') The activation function of the output layer.
