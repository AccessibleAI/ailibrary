Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Notes for this Component

1) The library enables the use of the algorithm both with cross validation and without. By default the library doesn't perform cross validation. If the user wishes to perform cross validation, 
the user needs to use the parameter: ```--x_val=NUMBER_OF_FOLDS```, which is ```--x_val=None``` by default.  
2) The path given by ```--data``` must be a path to a csv file which is already processed and ready for training. This means that the csv must not contain: 
   
   - NaN values (empty cells) 
  
   - Strings 
  
   - Columns whose names start with 'Unnamed'.

## Parameters

### cnvrg.io parameters

```--data``` - str, required. Path to `.csv` file (the dataset). Assumes that the files includes only integers and floats (no strings), and the table is built as such: all the columns but the 
rightmost one are considered as features columns (x), and the rightmost one is the label column (y).

```--x_val``` - int, optional (default = 5). Number of folds for the cross-validation.

```--test_split``` - float, optional (default = 0.2). The portion of the data for testing.

```--output_model``` - str, optional (default = 'kNearestNeighborsModel.sav') The name of the output file which is a trained model. 

### Algorithm parameters

```--n_estimators``` - int, optional (default = 10). The number of trees in the forest.
Default value will be changed in future release.

```--criterion``` - str, optional (default = ”gini”). The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are “gini” for the Gini impurity and “entropy” for the information gain.
Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

```--max_depth``` - int or None, optional (default = None). The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.

```--min_samples_split``` - int, float, optional (default = 2). The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
 - If int, then consider min_samples_split as the minimum number.
 - If float, then min_samples_split is a fraction and `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum number of samples for each split.

```--min_samples_leaf``` - int, float, optional (default = 1). The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.
 - If int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number. 
 - If float, then min_samples_leaf is a fraction and `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum number of samples for each node.

```--min_weight_fraction_leaf``` - float, optional (default = 0). The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

```--max_features``` - int, float, str or None, optional (default = None).
The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:  
 - If int, then consider max_features features at each split.  
 - If float, then max_features is a fraction and `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each split.  
 - If 'auto', then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.  
 - If 'sqrt', then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)` (same as “auto”).
 - If 'log2', then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.  
 - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.  
Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to effectively inspect more than max_features features.

```--max_leaf_nodes``` - int or None, optional (default = None). Grow trees with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None, then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

```--min_impurity_decrease``` - float, optional (default = 0).
A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.
The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:  
N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity  
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)  
where `N` is the total number of samples, `N_t` is the number of samples at the current node, `N_t_L` is the number of samples in the left child, and `N_t_R` is the number of samples in the right child.
`N`, `N_t`, `N_t_R` and `N_t_L` all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.

```--min_impurity_split``` - float, (default = 1e-7). Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

```--boostrap``` - bool, optional (default = True). Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the whole dataset is used to build each tree.

```--oob_score``` - bool (default = False). Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization accuracy.

```--n_jobs``` - int or None, optional (default = None). The number of jobs to run in parallel for both fit and predict. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors.

```--random_state``` - int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default = None).
 - If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator.
 - If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator.
 - If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by np.random.

```--verbose``` - int, optional (default = 0). Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

```--warm_start``` - bool, optional (default = False). When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole new forest. 

```--class_weight``` - dict, list of dicts, “balanced”, “balanced_subsample” or None, optional (default = None). Weights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.
