Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks 
that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode 
of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Notes for this Component

1) The library enables the use of the algorithm both with cross validation and without. By default the library doesn't perform cross validation. If the user wishes to perform cross validation, 
the user needs to use the parameter: ```--x_val=NUMBER_OF_FOLDS```, which is ```--x_val=None``` by default.  
2) The path given by ```--data``` must be a path to a csv file which is already processed and ready for training. This means that the csv must not contain: 
   
   - NaN values (empty cells) 
  
   - Strings 
  
   - Columns whose names start with 'Unnamed'.

## Parameters

### cnvrg.io parameters

* ```--data``` - Required param. String. Path to .csv file (the dataset). Assumes that the files includes only integers and floats (no strings), and 
the table built like: all the columns but the rightmost one are considered as features columns (X), and the rightmost one is the label column (y).

* ```--x_val``` - Integer. Number of folds for the cross-validation. Default is 5.

* ```--test_split``` - Float. The portion of the data of testing. Default is 0.2.

* ```--output_model``` - String. The name of the output file which is a trained random forests model. Default is random_forest_regressor.sav

### Algorithm parameters

```--n_estimators``` - integer, optional (default=10). The number of trees in the forest.
Changed in version 0.20: The default value of n_estimators will change from 10 in version 0.20 to 100 in version 0.22.

```--criterion``` - string, optional (default=”gini”)
The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are “gini” for the Gini impurity and “entropy” for the information gain. Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

```--max_depth``` - integer or None, optional (default=None)
The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.

```--min_samples_split``` - int, float, optional (default=2)
The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
If int, then consider min_samples_split as the minimum number.
If float, then min_samples_split is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each split.

```--min_samples_leaf``` - int, float, optional (default=1)
The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.
If int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number.
If float, then min_samples_leaf is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each node.

```--min_weight_fraction_leaf``` - float, optional (default=0.)
The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

```--max_features``` -  int, float, string or None, optional (default=”auto”)
The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
If int, then consider max_features features at each split.
If float, then max_features is a fraction and int(max_features * n_features) features are considered at each split.
If “auto”, then max_features=sqrt(n_features).
If “sqrt”, then max_features=sqrt(n_features) (same as “auto”).
If “log2”, then max_features=log2(n_features).
If None, then max_features=n_features.
Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to effectively inspect more than max_features features.

```--max_leaf_nodes``` - int or None, optional (default=None)
Grow trees with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

```--min_impurity_decrease``` - float, optional (default=0.)
A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.
The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:
N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.
N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.

```--boostrap``` - boolean, optional (default=True)
Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the whole datset is used to build each tree.

```--oob_score``` - bool (default=False). Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization accuracy.

```--n_jobs``` - int or None, optional (default=None). The number of jobs to run in parallel for both fit and predict. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.

```--random_state``` - int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by np.random.

```--verbose``` - int, optional (default=0)
Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

```--warm_start``` - bool, optional (default=False)
When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole new forest.
