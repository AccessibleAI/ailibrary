The metrics which the algorithm returns are:

```model``` - The name of the output model file.

```folds``` - The number of folds used in the cross validation (if demanded by the user).

```train_loss_MSE``` - The train error evaluated by mean squared error.

```train_loss_MAE``` - The train error evaluated by mean absolute error.

```train_loss_R2``` - The train error evaluated by R2.

```test_loss_MSE``` - The test error evaluated by mean squared error.

```test_loss_MAE``` - The test error evaluated by mean absolute error.

```test_loss_R2``` - The test error evaluated by R2.
